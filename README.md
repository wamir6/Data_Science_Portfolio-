  - [Simple Linear Regression](https://github.com/wamir6/Simple-Linear-Regression/blob/master/Simple%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb): Small playground to summarize and study relationships between two continuous variables from a randomized dataset.
  - [Iris dataset(Logistic Regression)](https://github.com/wamir6/Iris-dataset-Logistic-Regression-/tree/master):I have used Logistic Regression to predict the class of the flower based on its available attributes(sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
  There are 50 observations of each species (setosa, versicolor, virginica).
